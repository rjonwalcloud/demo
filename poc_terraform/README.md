**Terraform** is an Infrastructure as Code tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

**Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.

**Difference between Terraform and Ansible**:
Terraform and Ansible are two popular tools used in the field of infrastructure as code (IAC). Both tools are used to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure, but they serve different purposes and offer different capabilities.
